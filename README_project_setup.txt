As requested, we have provided an overview to get the complete project running on a user's system. However, the given 
explanation for the system involves several URL links, images, and other document features that are not possible to include 
in this short text explanation. Hence, rather than copying over the possible parts into this README file, we instead 
direct the user to consult the 'System Setup: Software and Data Preparation' section within the final report. 
Alternatively, consult the 'System Setup' document within the 'report_stuff\report_parts\' directory for an in-depth 
explanation about how one would setup the source data directory ('local directory'), the Python language with required 
libraries, the ideal integrated development environment, and so on.
