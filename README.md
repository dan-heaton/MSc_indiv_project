# Recurrent Neural Networks and Conditional Random Fields for Activity Recognition in Human Movement
## Overview
* Ongoing MSc project applying RNNs and CRFs to human movement data of children with Duchenne’s
muscular dystrophy, working with Great Ormond Street Hospital as part of a wider initiative (see:
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/184530/ai-trial-help-accelerate-future-treatments/)

* Data provided shows bodysuit captures of subjects with DMD undergoing North Star Ambulatory Assessment
and walking trials to assess severity of their condition, with the aims of the project being to assist specialists
assessing new subject’s North Star scores and identify the most influential activities on subject’s assessment

* Project involves collaboration with senior department research associates, large amount of data preparation,
working with numerous different types of raw measurements from different sensors, statistical feature
extraction, data visualization, feature selection and reduction, and model training, tuning, and selection

* Implementing entirety of the project in Python and involves working with numerous input/output file types,
along with using TensorFlow extensively to implement, train, and load RNN models, using scikit-learn for
various machine learning tools and techniques, and using pandas and numpy for processing data
